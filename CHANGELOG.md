[trackconversion]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#trackconversion

# Changelog
## 4.17.2 - 2025-10-30
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue where [`Conversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#conversion)'s metadata initialized with a name was not tracked.
* Changed the **Unexpected TargetingConditionType** log's level to `INFO`.

## 4.17.1 - 2025-09-04
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue where a proxy host value was converted incorrectly.

## 4.17.0 - 2025-08-29
### Features
* Added an `overwrite` flag to [`CustomData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#customdata), used as the `overwrite` parameter during tracking.
* [`CustomData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#customdata) can now be created using a `name`, in addition to the existing method of using an `index`.
* Added a new property `defaultVariationKey` and a method `getDefaultVariation()` to [`FeatureFlag`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#featureflag). The method returns information about the default variation associated with the feature flag.
* Added a new property `rules` of type [`List<Rule>`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#rule) to [`FeatureFlag`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#featureflag), which defines the targeting rules associated with the feature flag.

## 4.16.0 - 2025-08-20
### Features
* Introduced a new [`getDataFile`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getdatafile) method. This method returns the current SDK configuration (also known as the **data file**) used for evaluation and targeting. It is **not** intended for production use to fetch variations for every feature flag in the returned list, as it is not optimized for performance. For that purpose, use [`getVariations`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#getvariations) instead. `getDataFile` is mainly useful for debugging or QA, for example to let internal users manually select a variant for a specific feature flag in production.
* Added a new property `name` to [`Variation`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#variation), representing the name of the variation.

## 4.15.0 - 2025-07-23
### Features
* Added the [`evaluateAudiences`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#evaluateaudiences) method. This method iterates over all Audiences Explorer segments, evaluates each one, and tracks the segments for which the visitor is targeted using the [`TARGETINGSEGMENT`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/apis/data-api-rest/all-endpoints/post-visit-events/) event.

## 4.14.1 - 2025-07-01
### Bug fixes
* Stability and performance improvements

## 4.14.0 - 2025-06-27
### Features
* Added support for using a Custom Data value for traffic bucketing instead of the default visitor code. [Learn More](https://help.kameleoon.com/create-feature-flag/#Advanced_Flag_Settings).
* Reduced the number of requests to OAuth service if it has outage.

## 4.13.0 - 2025-05-26
### Features
* Added support for a **New**/**Returning** visitor breakdown filter in reports (requires calling [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getremotevisitordata)).
* Added support for **304 (Not Modified)** responses from the SDK config service to avoid redundant updates and reduce traffic when the configuration hasn't changed.
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue where the value of the `negative` parameter was ignored in the [`trackConversion(String visitorCode, int goalId, boolean negative, float revenue)`][trackconversion] method overload.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 4.12.2 - 2025-04-08
### Bug fixes
* Changed the order in which **conversion** and **experiment** events are sent. This may lead to more accurate **visit**-level experiment reporting.

## 4.12.1 - 2025-03-26
### Bug fixes
* The value of the `revenue` parameter was not accounted for in some overloads of the [`trackConversion`][trackconversion] method.

## 4.12.0 - 2025-03-24
### Features
* Added new optional parameters `negative` and `metadata` to the [`trackConversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#trackconversion) method.
* Added new optional parameter `metadata` to the [`Conversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#conversion) data constructor.
* Changed the log level for deprecated methods from **WARNING** to **INFO**.

## 4.11.0 - 2025-03-18
### Features
* Added support for Contextual Bandit evaluations. Calling [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getremotevisitordata) with the `cbs=true` flag is required for this feature to function correctly. Platform-wide release expected in March 2025.

## 4.10.0 - 2025-02-26
### Features
* Added SDK support for **Mutually Exclusive Groups**. When feature flags are grouped into a **Mutually Exclusive Group**, only one flag in the group will be evaluated at a time. All other flags in the group will automatically return their default variation.
* Added new configuration parameter `networkDomain` (`network_domain`) to [`KameleoonClientConfig`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#create) and the [configuration](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#additional-configuration) file. This parameter allows specifying a custom domain for all outgoing network requests.
* Added support for new conditions:
    - Exclusive Campaign
    - Experiment
    - Personalization

## 4.9.0 - 2025-02-10
### Features
* Added SDK support for **holdout experiments**. Visitors assigned to a holdout experiment are excluded from all other rollouts and experiments, and consistently receive the default variation. For visitors not in a holdout experiment, the standard evaluation process applies, allowing them to be evaluated for all feature flags as usual. Platform-wide release expected in February 2025.

## 4.8.1 - 2024-12-05
### Bug fixes
* Resolved an issue where the SDK could waste memory by creating new connections to the SSE server when utilizing the [Real-Time Streaming Architecture](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/technical-considerations/#streaming) if the SSE server was down.
* Fixed an issue where the provided cookie values could not be applied when setting **simulated** variations.

## 4.8.0 - 2024-11-28
### Features
* Added support for **simulated** variations.
* Added the [`setForcedVariation()`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#setforcedvariation) method. This method allows explicitly setting a forced variation for a visitor, which will be applied during experiment evaluation.
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue where the [`Variation.isActive()`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#variation) method returned an incorrect value.

## 4.7.2 - 2024-11-19
### Bug fixes
* Resolved an issue where the validation of [top-level domains](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#additional-configuration) for `localhost` resulted in incorrect failures. The SDK now accepts the provided domain without modification if it is deemed invalid and logs an [error](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#log-levels) to notify you of any issues with the specified domain.

## 4.7.1 - 2024-11-14
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue with the [`Page URL`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/using-visit-history-in-feature-flags-and-experiments/#benefits-of-calling-getremotevisitordata) and [`Page Title`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/using-visit-history-in-feature-flags-and-experiments/#benefits-of-calling-getremotevisitordata) targeting conditions, where the condition evaluated all previously visited URLs in the session instead of only the current URL, corresponding to the latest added [`PageView`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#pageview).<br/>
**NOTE**: This change may impact your existing targeting. Please review your targeting conditions to ensure accuracy.

## 4.7.0 - 2024-10-24
### Features
* Introduced a new package with support for [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/), complementing the existing package for [Java EE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html). The new package is now available in the [Maven repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.kameleoon/kameleoon-client-java-jakarta). For more detailed information, please refer to [this documentation](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#install-the-java-client).
* Introduced a new `visitorCode` parameter to [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#using-parameters-in-getremotevisitordata). This parameter determines whether to use the `visitorCode` from the most recent previous visit instead of the current `visitorCode`. When enabled, this feature allows visitor exposure to be based on the retrieved `visitorCode`, facilitating [cross-device reconciliation](https://developers.kameleoon.com/core-concepts/cross-device-experimentation/). Default value of the parameter is `true`.
* Use [`RemoteVisitorDataFilterBuilder`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#using-parameters-in-getremotevisitordata) instead of the deprecated [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#using-parameters-in-getremotevisitordata) constructor.

## 4.6.0 - 2024-10-04
### Features
* Introduced new evaluation methods for clarity and improved efficiency when working with the SDK:
  - [`getVariation`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#getvariation)
  - [`getVariations`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#getvariations)
* These methods replace the deprecated ones:
  - [`getFeatureVariationKey`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getfeaturevariationkey)
  - [`getFeatureVariable`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getfeaturevariable)
  - [`getFeatureVariables`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getfeaturevariables)
  - [`getActiveFeatures`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getactivefeatures)
  - [`getFeatureVariationVariables`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getfeaturevariationvariables)
* A new version of the [`isFeatureActive`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#isfeatureactive) method now includes an optional `track` parameter, which controls whether the assigned variation is tracked (default: `true`).
* Enhanced top-level domain validation within the SDK. The implementation now includes automatic trimming of extraneous symbols and provides a [warning](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#log-levels) when an invalid domain is detected.
* Enhanced the [`getEngineTrackingCode`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getenginetrackingcode) method to properly handle `JS` and `CSS` variables.

## 4.5.1 - 2024-08-13
### Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue that caused duplicate entries in feature flag results for both anonymous and authorized/identified visitors during data reconciliation. This problem occurred when custom data of type mapping ID was not consistently sent for all sessions.

## 4.5.0 - 2024-08-01
### Features
* Added [`waitInit`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#waitinit) method, which allows to check if the client has been successfully initialized before proceeding with other operations.
### Bug fixes
* Resolved an issue where the SDK could become stuck during prolonged Data API outages.

## 4.4.0 - 2024-07-11
### Features
* Enhanced [logging](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#logging):
    - Introduced [log levels](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#log-levels):
        - `None`
        - `Error`
        - `Warning`
        - `Info`
        - `Debug`
    - Added support for [custom logger](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#custom-handling-of-logs) implementations.
* Improved the tracking mechanism to consolidate multiple visitors into a single request. The new approach combines information on all affected visitors into one request, which is sent once per interval.
* Added a new variation of the [`flush(boolean instant, String visitorCode)`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#flush) with `instant` parameter. If the parameter's value is `true` the visitor's data is tracked instantly. Otherwise, the visitor's data will be tracked with next tracking interval. Default value of the parameter is `false`.
* Added new configuration parameter `trackingInterval` (`tracking_interval_millisecond`) to [`KameleoonClientConfig`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#additional-configuration) and the [configuration](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#additional-configuration) file, which is used to set interval for tracking requests. Default value is `1000` milliseconds.
* New Kameleoon Data type [`UniqueIdentifier`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#uniqueidentifier) is introduced. It will be used in all methods instead of `isUniqueIdentifier` parameter. All methods with `isUniqueIdentifier` parameter are marked as deprecated:
    - [`flush`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#flush)
    - [`trackConversion`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#trackconversion)

    - [`getFeatureVariables`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getfeaturevariables)
    - [`isFeatureActive`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#isfeatureactive)
    - [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getremotevisitordata)
### Bug fixes
* Resolved an issue where the [`flush(null, isUniqueIdentifier)`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#flush) method was incorrectly sending requests with `isUniqueIdentifier` applied to each visitor. Now, `isUniqueIdentifier` is only considered if `visitorCode` is provided and not null.

## 4.3.0 - 2024-06-13
### Features
* The [Likelihood to convert](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/using-visit-history-in-feature-flags-and-experiments) targeting condition is now available. Pre-loading the data is required using [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk#getremotevisitordata) with the `kcs` parameter set to `true`.
* Added [`getActiveFeatures`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#getActiveFeatures) method uses for obtaining a information about the active feature flags that are available for the visitor.
* Method [`getActiveFeatureListForVisitorCode`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#getActiveFeatureListForVisitorCode) is deprecated
### Bug fixes
* Resolved an issue where the [`getVisitorCode`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#getvisitorcode) did not apply the provided `defaultVisitorCode`.

### Bug fixes
* Stability and performance improvements

## 3.3.1 - 2023-09-28
### Bug fixes
* Stability and performance improvements

## 3.3.0 - 2023-09-25
### Features
* Added new parameter [`sessionDuration`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#additional-configuration) to `KameleoonConfiguration` and `session_duration` field to the external configuration file. The session duration setting determines the time (in minutes) that a visitor's data is retained in RAM. When a session expires, the visitor data is deleted. You can restore the data using [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#getRemoteVisitorData). The `visitorDataMaximumSize` method has been deprecated. Use the new `sessionDuration` method instead.
* Starting from this release, it is now imperative that your application gracefully handles `HttpException` exceptions (using the `exceptionally` method of the `CompletableFuture` instance) for the following methods:
    - [`getRemoteData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#getRemoteData)
    - [`getRemoteVisitorData`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/java-sdk.html#getRemoteVisitorData)
* Introduced a new data parameter called [`LegalConsent`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#legalconsent) which can have values of `true` or `false`. It's used to indicate whether legal consent is received from visitors or not. The [`LegalConsent`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#legalconsent) parameter determines which data can be included in tracking requests, enabling to adhere to legal and regulatory requirements while responsibly managing visitor data. More information could be found at: https://help.kameleoon.com/consent-management-policy/
* Changed syntax for creation of [`Device`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#device) and [`Browser`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/java-sdk/#browser) data:
    - `Device::DESKTOP` is now `Device.desktop()`
    - `Device::TABLET` is now `Device.tablet()`
    - `Device::PHONE` is now `Device.phone()`
    - `Browser::CHROME` is now `Browser.chrome()`
    - `Browser::INTERNET_EXPLORER` is now `Browser.internetExplorer()`
    - `Browser::FIREFOX` is now `Browser.firefox()`
    - `Browser::SAFARI` is now `Browser.safari()`
    - `Browser::OPERA` is now `Browser.opera()`
    - `Browser::OTHER` is now `Browser.other()`
